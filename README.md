# Mercury-apps
[Mercury](https://github.com/mljar/mercury) allows you to add interactive widgets in Python notebooks, so you can share notebooks as web applications. It is an open-source tool that can be used to create web apps straight from jupyter notebooks without much hassle. Just build your app first in jupyter notebook and then deploy using Mercury. It is incredibly fast too as every update made to the notebook will instantly be reflected in the app.

Mercury is also better than other web app creators like Streamlit. Streamlit applications are primarily powered by Python scripts, not interactive Python kernels. Thus, while developing an application with Streamlit, one has to repeatedly run a script to see the progress. However, apps created with Mercury are driven by a Jupyter Notebook, and every update is instantly reflected in the web app. 

Moreover, web apps created with Mercury can be easily exported with the click of a button. This allows you to easily share your applications with others over email and the recipient does not necessarily need to have Mercury installed. It also provides secure authentication so you can instantly [enable authentication](https://runmercury.com/docs/authentication/) to secure your web apps. 

Notebooks can be easily deployed to the cloud with [Mercury Cloud](https://cloud.runmercury.com/). Just upload the notebook, and you are done. As simple as that.
